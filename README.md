# MiniGame-413
MiniGame created for the Hack(H)er413 2021 mini game challenge. Here's a fun way to make people aware of the global pandemic 
and motivate them to stay safe from it! It's a simple game in which the character runs and tries to avoid corona virus 
(the villain of our game) by jumping or sliding. The game is based on pygame.

Our project came second in the challenge!
